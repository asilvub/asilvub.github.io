# Replication Files
The following folders replicate the results in our paper Cerda, Silva and Luders (2020). Below I describe each folder/file.

There are three folders in this replication package: *Data, do and Results*.

1. *Data/dta/prices.dta*: contains monthly data for 23 food products that we make available for free for other researchers. Whenever you use this data, please cite our paper as follows:
> *Cerda, Rodrigo, Alvaro Silva and Rolf Luders (2020): "Price Controls, Hyperinflation, and the Inflation-Relative Price Variability Relationship." Forthcoming, Empirical Economics.*

Also, it contains information on:
- Monthly economic activity
- Copper price
- Consumer Price Index (Official)
- Weights (and reweights) for each of the 23 food products as of 1969 compilation.

2. *do/graphs*: plot Figures 1 to 4 in Cerda, Silva and Luders (2020).
3. *do/Replication_CSL*: Replicates Tables 1 to 8 in Cerda, Silva and Luders (2020).

4. *Results/Graphs*: Output from graphs.do
5. *Results/Tables*: Contains output from Replication_CSL.do (TeX files for tables 1 to 8)
6. *Results/output/output.txt*: log file from Replication_CSL.do

Feel free to email me if you have any question regarding the data or the codes!
